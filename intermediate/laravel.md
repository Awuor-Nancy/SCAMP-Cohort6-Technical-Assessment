# Laravel Technical Assessment  

## Automated Payment Reminder Application

In freelancing, invoicing clients and chasing them for cash is a time-consuming procedure. If you're a freelancer or plan to be one in the future, this project will benefit you in two ways: improving your node.js abilities and providing you with an application to track client payments.

This application will not only create, send, and receive invoices, but it will also send out automated payment reminders. And, of course, your application will address the world's most pressing freelance issue.

## Functional requirements
- Users should be able to save the details of the client.
- Users can create new invoices within the application.
- Users can send invoices to clients directly through the application.
- The application should automatically send payment alerts (through emails or text) to clients for overdue payments.
- Invoices should contain a link that allows clients to pay immediately.

## Application Requirements
- Security
- Scalability
- Consistency
- Testing

## What to look out for 
The essence of this challenge is to understand the approach you take to:
- Using an ORM to interact with a simple database model
- Creating a primary routing mechanism for HTTP requests
- Authenticating a user's access to a route
- Responding to a request in a consistent and logical manner
- Testing your work.
  

## Submission
- Create a repository on Github called ``SCAMP-C6 Assessment``
- Push your project to the github repo created
- Include your setup instructions on your README doc
- Documentation URL (optional)
- submit your project github URL on the application form here: [Cohort 6 Application](http://shecodeafrica.org/events) 



*Good luck!*
