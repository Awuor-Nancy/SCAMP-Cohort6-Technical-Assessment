# Product Design (Intermmediate)  Assessment  

## The Problem
- I have 5 SCA group chats and over 20 Direct messages (DMs)  from the SCA community members on WhatsApp. It has become difficult to manage all my SCA activities on WhatsApp.


## The Task 
- Create a feature that will allow me to have all my SCA-related groups and Direct Messages under one community and manage it effectively. See Slack and discord for inspiration.
- Explain your Design process.
( Bonus: Prototype your design to show a working demo.) 


## Submission 
- Submit a link to the figma file on the application form here: [SCA Events](http://shecodeafrica.org/events) 
*Good luck!*
