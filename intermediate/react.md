# React Technical Assessment  
- Create a repository on Github called ``SCAMP-C6 Assessment``

- Using React, build out the Eccommerce Product page below. ![ e-commerce product page](/intermediate/frontend/frontend-desktop.jpg?raw=true) 
Get it looking as close to the design as possible. The design images are inside the [frontend](/intermediate/frontend) folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.


## Aesthetic Requirements
The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you’ll need to use your best judgment for styles such as font-size, padding, margin and images. Use any preferred product images to replace the Sneaker.
  
## Functional requirements 
- User should be able to view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device’s screen size
- User should be able to see hover states for all interactive elements on the page 
- User should be able to switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images 

## Submission
- Push your project to the repo created
- Include a link to your live hosted project on your github readme.md file.
- submit your project github URL on the application form here: [Cohort 6 Application](http://shecodeafrica.org/events) 


*Good luck!*
